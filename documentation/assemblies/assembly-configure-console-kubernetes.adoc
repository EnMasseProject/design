= Configuring {ProductName} Console on Kubernetes

To use the {ProductName} Console on Kubernetes, you must either configure Kubernetes to use
https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#openid-connect-tokens[OpenID Connect (OIDC)]
as an Authentication Strategy, or configure the {ProductName} Console to use an OIDC provider not
configured with the cluster.

If you are running on a Kubernetes cluster with OIDC enabled, then the recommended way to configure
the console is to use the OIDC provider of the cluster.

If you are running on a managed Kubernetes cluster, the OIDC Authentication Strategy is usually not
enabled, so configuring the console using an external OIDC provider is the only way.
