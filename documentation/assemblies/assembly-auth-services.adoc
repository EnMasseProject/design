= Authentication services

Authentication services are used to configure the authentication and authorization endpoints
available to messaging clients. The authentication services are configured by the {ProductName}
service operator, and are specified when creating an address space. 

Authentication services are configured as Custom Resources. An authentication service has a type, which can be `standard`, `external`, or `none`.
