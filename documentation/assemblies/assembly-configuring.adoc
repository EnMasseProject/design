= Configuring {ProductName}

The service operator configures {ProductName} by defining resources constituting the "service configuration". This configuration contains instances of the following resource types:

* `AuthenticationService`  - Describes an authentication service instance used to authenticate messaging clients.
* `AddressSpacePlan` - Describes the messaging resources available for address spaces using this plan, such as the available address plans, the amount of router and broker resources that can be used.
* `AddressPlan` - Describes the messaging resources consumed by a particular address using this plan, such as what fraction of routers and brokers an address will use and other properties that should be set for multiple addresses.
* `StandardInfraConfig` - Describes the router and broker configuration for the `standard` address space type such as memory limits, storage capacity, affinity and more.
* `BrokeredInfraConfig` - Describes the broker configuration for the `brokered` address space type such as memory limits, storage capacity, affinity, and more.

When created, these resources defines the configuration that are available to the messaging tenants.

The following diagram illustrates the relationship between the different service configuration resources (green) and how they are referenced by the messaging tenant resources (blue).
