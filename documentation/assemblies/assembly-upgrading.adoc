= Upgrading {ProductName}

{ProductName} supports upgrades between minor versions using cloud native tools and the same
mechanism used to apply configuration changes.  When upgrading, the updated infrastructure
configuration of the new version will trigger the upgrade to start.

Upgrading {ProductName} is done by applying the YAML files for the new version.

Once {ProductName} is upgraded, the Address Spaces can then be upgraded see link: {BookUrlBase}{BaseProductVersion}{BookNameUrl}#upgrading-address-spaces[Upgrading Address Spaces].
