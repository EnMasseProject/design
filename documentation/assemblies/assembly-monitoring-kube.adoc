[id='monitoring-kube-{context}']
= Monitoring {ProductName} on Kubernetes

Monitoring services run frequent health checks  on {ProductName} and send alerts when health checks
fail. Health is assessed using Prometheus and `kube-state-metrics`. Alerting is implemented with
`Alertmanager`. Grafana is also configured to provide a dashboard of the current status of health
checks.
