[id='managing-addresses-{context}']
= Managing addresses

{ProductName} is configured to support managing addresses using the {KubePlatform} command-line tools
and the {ProductName} Console. `Address` resources can be managed like any other {KubePlatform}
API resource using `{cmdcli}`.

Some address types also support changing the `plan` field: `queue`, `anycast` and `multicast`
address types in the `standard` address space support changing the plan as long as the new plan
does not exceed the allowed quota. For queues, addresses are dynamically migrated across brokers
which may cause reordering of messages.
