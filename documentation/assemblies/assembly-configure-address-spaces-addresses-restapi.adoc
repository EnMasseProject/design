= Configuring address spaces and addresses using a REST API

{ProductName} provides an API that can be used for configuring address spaces and addresses
within those address spaces. Clients can be configured to authenticate using
https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/[RBAC^]. 

All API URIs are namespaced. This means that address spaces are scoped within a particular
namespace. Addresses are scoped within an address space. This means that an address
space in address space A may have the same name as an address in address space B.

Likewise, an address space in namespace A can have the same name as an address space in namespace B.
