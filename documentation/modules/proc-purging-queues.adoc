= Purging queues and subscriptions

You can purge--that is, clear all messages from--a `queue` or `subscription` address type of its stored messages by using the {ConsoleName}.

.Prerequisites

* You must have a queue or subscription that contains stored messages.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {ConsoleName}. For more information, see link:{BookUrlBase}{BaseProductVersion}{BookNameUrl}#logging-into-console-messaging[Accessing the {ConsoleName}].

. Navigate to the *Addresses* page.

. Select the check box next to the queue or subscription that you want to purge.

. At the top of the page, right-click the vertical ellipsis icon and select *Purge*. The queue or subscription is purged, and the `Stored` message count drops to zero for the selected queue or subscription.
