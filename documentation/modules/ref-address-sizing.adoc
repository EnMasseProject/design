= Address sizing

Per address broker memory limits are calculated from the address plan configuration. {ProductName} determines the maximum size allowed for each queue by multiplying the broker configuration `globalMaxSize` (specified in the `standardinfraconfig` or `brokeredinfraconfig`) by the address planâ€™s broker resource limit. The behavior when the queue reaches its memory limit is governed by the address full policy. For more information on the address full policy, see link:{BookUrlBase}{BaseProductVersion}{BookNameUrl}#broker-component-sizing-messaging[Broker component sizing].

For example, if the broker's configuration specifies `globalMaxSize` = 124 MB and the address plan configuration specifies `addressplan.spec.resources.broker` = 0.2, the maximum size allowed for each queue is 25 MB (`124 * 0.2 = 25 MB`).
