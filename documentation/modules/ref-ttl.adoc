The `ttl` field is used to restrict the effective link:http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0-os.html#type-properties[`absolute-expiry-time`] of
any message put to a queue or topic. The `maximum` and `minimum` values, defined in milliseconds will adjust the TTL value of an incoming messages to that address if

* If a messages arrives at the address with a TTL value that is greater than the `maximum` value, the system changes the message TTL to the maximum value.
* If a messages arrives with a TTL value that is less than the `minimum`, the TTL is changed to the minimum.

Messages arriving without a TTL defined are considered to have a TTL value of infinity when considered by these rules.

Expired messages will be automatically removed from the `queue`, `subscription` or temporary topic subscription periodically. These messages are lost. This occurs every 30 seconds.
