[id='infrastructure-configuration-{context}']
= Infrastructure configuration 

{ProductName} creates infrastructure components such as routers, brokers, and consoles. These
components can be configured while the system is running, and {ProductName} automatically updates
the components with the new settings.

The {ProductName} service operator can edit the {ProductName} default infrastructure configuration.

Infrastructure configuration can be managed for both `brokered` and `standard` infrastructure
using `BrokeredInfraConfig` and `StandardInfraConfig` resources.
