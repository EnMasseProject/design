The subscription address type allows a subscription to be created for a topic that holds messages
published to the topic even if the subscriber is not attached. The subscription is accessed by the
consumer using <topic-address>::<subscription-address>. For example, for a subscription `mysub` on a
topic `mytopic` the consumer consumes from the address `mytopic::mysub`. By default, only a single
consumer is allowed per subscription. This can be specified using `maxConsumers` setting of
the subscription address.

NOTE: The `maxConsumers` setting can not be modified for existing subscriptions at present.
