= Creating an address

.Procedure

. Save the following YAML data to a `address.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml,options="nowrap"]
----
apiVersion: enmasse.io/v1alpha1
kind: Address
metadata:
    name: myspace.myqueue
spec:
    address: myqueue
    type: queue
    plan: pooled-queue
----

NOTE: Prefixing the name with the address space name is required to ensure addresses from different address spaces do not collide.

. Create the address using the command line:
+
[source,yaml,options="nowrap"]
----
{cmdcli} create -f address.yaml
----

. You can now list addresses:
+
[source,yaml,options="nowrap"]
----
{cmdcli} get addresses
----
