{ProductName} supports sharing the same messaging system between multiple isolated tenants. This allows the operations team to monitor and manage a predictable footprint of routers and brokers, and improves resource utilization.

As {KubePlatform} namespaces are used to isolate different messaging tenants, each tenant will have a unique prefix for its addresses internally. However, when connecting to the messaging system from applications, the application does not need to be aware of this prefix.

Self-service:: {ProductName} allows development teams to provision messaging resources as if they were using a public cloud service.
