<1> (Optional) Restricts message time-to-live (TTL). Applies to address types `queue` and `topic` only.

TTL restrictions may also be imposed by the address plan.  If a TTL restriction is imposed at both the plan and the address,
the address TTL restriction can only further narrow the TTL restriction.  The address `status` section shows the
TTL values that are in force.
