<1> Restricts message time-to-live (TTL). Applies to address types `queue` and `topic` only. (Optional)

include::ref-ttl.adoc[]

TTL restrictions may also be imposed at by the address plan.  If a TTL is imposed at both the plan and the address,
the address tll restriction can only further narrow the TTL restriction.  The address `status` section shows the
TTL values that are in force.
