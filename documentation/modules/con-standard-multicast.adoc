// !standard.address.multicast.longDescription:start
The multicast address type is a scalable direct address for sending messages to multiple consumers. Messages sent to a multicast address are forwarded to all consumers receiving messages on that address. Only pre-settled messages can be sent to multicast addresses, because message acknowledgments from consumers are not propagated to producers.
