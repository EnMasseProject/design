= Enabling Tenant Metrics

Metrics from brokers and routers can be exposed to tenants without exposing system-admin metrics. To expose tenant metrics create a service monitor in any non-`{ProductNamespace}` namespace, ideally the namespace of the concerned address space(s).

.Prerequisites

* The `servicemonitor` Custom Resource Definition provided by the Prometheus Operator must be installed.
* The tenant must have their own monitoring stack installed.

.Procedure

* Creata a `servicemonitor` resource with a the selector configured to match labels of `monitoring-key: enmasse-tenants` and the `{ProductNamespace}` as the namespace selector. An example service monitor is shown below:

+
[options="nowrap",subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: enmasse-tenants
  labels:
    app: enmasse
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      monitoring-key: enmasse-tenants
  endpoints:
  - port: health
  namespaceSelector:
    matchNames:
      - {ProductNamespace}
----

* Ensure the tenant's monitoring stack has read permissions for service monitors in the service monitor's namespace but not in the `{ProductNamespace}` as this would expose service-admin metrics too.
