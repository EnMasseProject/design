= Address space plans

Address space plans are used to configure quotas and control the resources consumed by address spaces. Address space plans are configured by the {ProductName} service operator and are selected when creating an address space.

{ProductName} includes a default set of plans that are sufficient for most use cases.

Plans are configured as custom resources. The following example shows a plan for the standard address space:

[source,yaml,options="nowrap"]
.link:resources/restrictive-plan.yaml[restrictive-plan.yaml]
----
include::../common/restrictive-plan.yaml[]
----

The following fields are required:

* `metadata.name`
* `resources`
* `addressPlans`
* `addressSpaceType`

The other fields are used by the {ProductName} Console UI. Note the annotation `enmasse.io/defined-by`, which
points to an infrastructure configuration that must exist when an address space using this plan is created.
For more information on infrastructure configurations, see xref:infrastructure-configuration-{context}[].
