= IoT tracing

using Jaeger. This feature allows service administrators to gain insight into the
inner workings of the IoT services to analyze system performance and issues.

By default, tracing support is not enabled and needs to be activated manually. For more information, see link:{BookUrlBase}{BaseProductVersion}{BookNameUrl}#proc-iot-tracing-messaging-iot-iot-iot[Configuring tracing].
