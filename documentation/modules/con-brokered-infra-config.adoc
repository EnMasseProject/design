= Brokered infrastructure configuration

`BrokeredInfraConfig` resources are used to configure infrastructure deployed by `brokered` address
spaces. Address space plans reference the brokered infrastructure configuration using the
`spec.infraConfigRef` field. For more information about address space plans, see link:{BookUrlBase}{BaseProductVersion}{BookNameUrl}#con-address-space-plans-messaging[Address space plans]. 

Only specific fields are pulled in from {KubePlatform}. For detailed information about the available brokered infrastructure configuration fields, see the link:{BookUrlBase}{BaseProductVersion}{BookNameUrl}#ref-brokered-infra-config-fields-messaging[Brokered infrastructure configuration fields table].
