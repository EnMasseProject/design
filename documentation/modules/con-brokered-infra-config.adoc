= Brokered infrastructure configuration

`BrokeredInfraConfig` resources is used to configure infrastructure deployed by `brokered` address
spaces. The brokered infra configuration is referenced by address space plans using a `enmasse.io/defined-by`
annotation. For more information, see xref:con-address-space-plans-{context}[].

The `version` field specifies the {ProductName} version used. When upgrading, {ProductName} uses
this field whether to upgrade the infrastructure to the requested version.

The `admin` object specifies the settings you can configure for the `admin` components.

The `broker` object specifies the settings you can configure for the `broker` components. Changing
the `.broker.resources.storage` setting does not configure existing broker storage size.
