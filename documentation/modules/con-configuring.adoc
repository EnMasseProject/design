[cols="50%,50%",options="header"]
|===
|Custom Resource type |Description
|`AuthenticationService` |Specifies an authentication service instance used to authenticate messaging clients.
|`AddressSpacePlan` |Specifies the messaging resources available for address spaces using this plan, such as the available address plans and the amount of router and broker resources that can be used.
|`AddressPlan` |Specifies the messaging resources consumed by a particular address using this plan, such as the fraction of routers and brokers an address can use and other properties that can be specified for multiple addresses.
|`StandardInfraConfig` |For the `standard` address space type, specifies the router and broker configuration such as memory limits, storage capacity, affinity, and more.
|`BrokeredInfraConfig` |For the `brokered` address space type, specifies the broker configuration  such as memory limits, storage capacity, affinity, and more.

When created, these Custom Resources define the configuration that is available to the messaging tenants.

The following diagram illustrates the relationship between the different service configuration resources (green) and how they are referenced by the messaging tenant resources (blue).
