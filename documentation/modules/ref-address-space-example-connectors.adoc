= Address space connector examples

You can federate a `standard` address space type with another AMQP server. Two methods of operation are supported: _remote address connection_ and _message store-and-forward_.

Remote address connection involves mapping addresses on a remote AMQP endpoint into an address space. For example, suppose an AMQP server is running on the host `messaging.example.com` that you want to access by connecting using the {ProductName} endpoints. To enable remote address connection, you need to create an address space connector.

Message store-and-forward involves enabling address forwarding. First you need to create an address space connector. Then, you need to create an address forwarder for each address. For more information about address forwarding, see link:{BookUrlBase}{BaseProductVersion}{BookNameUrl}#ref-address-example-forwarders-messaging[Address forwarding examples].

The following examples show how you can configure an address space connector.

== Address space connector using SASL PLAIN

You can use SASL PLAIN when you do not want to use mutual TLS for authentication. Not enabling TLS is not recommended, since any user names and passwords are then sent as plain text.

----
<1> (Required) Specifies the name of the connector. All remote addresses are prefixed with the connector name and a forward slash, `/`.
<2> (Required) Specifies a list of endpoints for this connector. This list must contain at least one entry, and any additional entries are used for failover. If not otherwise specified, the `port` field value is set to the registered IANA port for AMQP (or AMQPS if TLS is enabled).
<3> (Optional) Idle timeout of AMQP connection (seconds). 0 disables the idle timeout.
<4> (Optional) Max frame size of AMQP connection.
<5> (Optional) Enable TLS. The connector trusts global root CAs by default. To use a custom CA, specify a value for the `caCert` field.
<6> (Optional) Specifies the username and password credentials to use for this connector. The values can be specified inline or by referencing a secret along with an optional key specifying the location within the secret. The secret must be readable by the `system:serviceaccounts:_{ProductNamespace}_` group.
<7> (Optional) Role of connector. Can be "normal", "route-container", "edge". Defaults to 'route-container'.
<8> (Required) Specifies a list of patterns matching addresses to be exposed on the remote endpoint. The pattern consists of one or more tokens separated by a forward slash, `/`. A token can be one of the following: a * character, a # character, or a sequence of characters that do not include /, *, or #. The * token matches any single token. The # token matches zero or more tokens. * has higher precedence than #, and exact match has the highest precedence.

== Address space connector using mutual TLS

Configuring a client TLS certificate enables SASL EXTERNAL to be used for authentication. The certificates can be specified inline or using a secret reference.
