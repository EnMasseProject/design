- Brokered:
- Standard:

* testCreateDeleteAnycast

* testFilterAddressesByName
- Create 2 queues: queue-via-web-N where N=1,3
- Create 2 topics: topic-via-web-M where M=0,2
- add filter for “web” and verify that 4 items is visible
- add filter for “via” and verify that 4 items is visible
- Remove filter “web”
- verify that 4 items is visible
- add filter for “queue” and verify that 2 items is visible
- Remove all filters and verify that 4 items is visible
- Remove addresses

* testFilterAddressesByType - *_here is a bug: filter by type doesn’t work in console!_*
- Create 2 queues: queue-via-web-N where N=1,3
- Create 2 topics: topic-via-web-M where M=0,2
- Filter all queues and verify that 2 items are visible
- Filter all topics and verify that 2 items are visible
- Remove addresses

* testSortAddressesByName
- Create 2 queues: queue-via-web-N where N=1,3
- Create 2 topics: topic-via-web-M where M=0,2
- Sort those addresses by name(ASC/DESC) and verify order
- Remove addresses

* testSortAddressesByClients
- Create 2 queues: queue-via-web-N where N=1,3
- Create 2 topics: topic-via-web-M where M=0,2
- Attach M+1 consumer to each topic and N+1 consumer to each queue
- Sort addresses by count of receivers
- Create M+1 senders and start sending messages to each topic (1 messages per 1 second)
- Sort addresses by count of senders and verify order
- Kill all clients
- Remove addresses
