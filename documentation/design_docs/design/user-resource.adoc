== why

Tenants currently need to create users and assign permissions using the Keycloak console or API when
using the standard address space.

However, usage of Keycloak is an implementation detail, and also a very crude interface.

This proposal is for creating users and managing user permissions using a custom API part of the api
server. 

== what/how

A new api group 'user.enmasse.io' will be created. It will support the following operations:

To create a user (oc create -f user1.yaml):
```
POST /apis/user.enmasse.io/v1alpha1/namespaces/myproject/messagingusers
```

To read a user (oc get myspace.user1):
```
GET /apis/user.enmasse.io/v1alpha1/namespaces/myproject/messagingusers/myspace.user1
```

To update a user (oc replace -f user1.yaml):

```
PUT /apis/user.enmasse.io/v1alpha1/namespaces/myproject/messagingusers/myspace.user1
```

To remove a user (oc delete enmasse-user myspace.user1)

```
DELETE /apis/user.enmasse.io/v1alpha1/namespaces/myproject/messagingusers/myspace.user1
```

In the same way as addresses, users are scoped by namespace _and_ address space and resource names
must include the address space name and username separated by a dot ('.').

A user may authentication using passwords or a federated identity. In the case of authentication
using a password, the password is provided upon creation on the user.  Subsequent reads of this
user will not be able to see the password, and so applications need to 'remember' the password
using secrets or other mechanisms.

```
apiVersion: user.enmasse.io/v1alpha1
kind: MessagingUser
metadata:
    name: myspace.user1
spec:
    authentication:
      type: password
      password: mypassword
    authorization:
    - addresses: [ "topic1", "topic2", "queue*" ]
      operations: [ "send", "recv", "view" ]
```

Users can also be authenticated using a federated identity where providers such as OpenShift can be
supported.

```
apiVersion: user.enmasse.io/v1alpha1
kind: MessagingUser 
metadata:
    name: myspace.user2
spec:
    authentication:
      type: federated
      provider: openshift
      openshiftUserid: openshift user id
      openshiftUsername: openshift user name
    authorization:
    - addresses: [ "*" ]
      operations: [ "send", "recv", "view" ]
    - operations: [ "manage" ]
```

The authorization policies describe what operations and on what addresses a particular user may
perform those operations. Operations can be either 'send', 'recv' or 'view', which can be applied to
individual or multiple addresses (using wildcards). The 'manage' operation is a special operation
that applies to all addresses and can be used for allow console user access (whereas view gives
read-only console access).

Addresses may contain wildcards. '*' will match all addresses.

As a future improvements, the concept of groups can be introduced where the authorization policies
can apply to multiple users.

=== Tasks

The following tasks are needed to support this proposal:

* Add support for new User type to java model
* Implement creating, updating, deleting, getting users in keycloak based on User
* Add support for the new API in api-server
* Ensure federated identities require no manual interaction in Keycloak (get rid of dialog in UI)

== testing

* Tests that create users and check that they have the correct permissions

== documentation

* Documentation covering how to manage users as well as updating swagger.json with the new API and
  resources.
