= Resource definitions

Resource describes a template along with a set of parameters. The resource definition is referenced from the plans. At present, only three resource definitions are supported:

* router
* broker
* broker-topic

Resource definitions with other names will not work with {ProductName}. It is, however, possible to modify these resource definitions to change the template and template parameters used when instantiating the infrastructure. For instance, the following configmap that increases the memory available for brokers can replace the default provided by {ProductName}:

[source,yaml,options="nowrap"]
.link:service_admin/broker-resource.yaml[broker-resource.yaml]
