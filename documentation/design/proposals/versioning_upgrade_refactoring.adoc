= Versioning and Upgrade Refactoring

== why

* approach to upgrade is inconsistent.
 ** for addressspaces, upgrade triggered by the fact that major.minor version on the plan disagrees with the major.minor
    of the running software.   There is no way to trigger the upgrade path for a mirco increment.
 ** for authenticationservices and consoleservice the code follows the OLM framework reconcile pattern.  For the upgrade
    use-case this is functional but the code has no knowledge of the 'from' major/minor/mirco.  This may be an impediment
    if we ever need to handle more sophisticated upgrades.
* No easy way for the user to determine major/minor/micro of the product being run.
 ** The console displays a version - this is always an upstream version even in the downstream product.
 ** No mechanism to determine the version from a command line.
