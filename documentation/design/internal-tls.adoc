There are three aspects of securing communications:

1. For internal clients to verify internal services
2. For internal services to verify internal clients
3. For keycloak to verify clients and vice versa


For 1. and 2., there are a couple of alternatives:

* Use certs for services, and SASL external for authenticating clients
    * Services (i.e. router) have a list of valid client ids
    * Client verifies service identity using openshift generated certificates
    * Pros:
        * ca signing handled automatically
    * Cons:
        * client validation requires internal sasl db for internal users in router

* Create per-address space CA that is used for generating per-service certificates
    * Clients trusts the address space CA.
    * Address controller trusts all generated CAs
    * Pros:
        * generic mechanism that works for all things that support TLS
    * Cons:
        * needs to maintain a mapping from services to certs
