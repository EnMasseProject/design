== scope

There are various different interfaces for externally facing
components that need to protected via authentication. There are also
two types of userbase:

1. there is the userbase for the openshift/kubernetes cluster that is
controlled by the cluster administrators

2. each address-space will have its own userbase that the owner of
that address space can control

=== address controller api

This is the HTTP based API allowing address spaces to be created and
deleted and the addresses within those to be defined.  The
address-controller component will authenticate requests against the
openshift/kubernetes userbase, presumably using OAuth tokens supplied
in the HTTP headers.

=== service broker api

The service broker implementation is part of the address
controller. This really just represents a slightly different API into
the same functionality for managing addresses and address-spaces.

The service broker api will only be called by the service catalog. The
credentials the catalog will use are defined in environment
variables. If these are set, the service broker implementation will
enforce that credentials supplied with any request match those in the
environment variables.

=== enmasse console

The console is a per address-space service and will authenticate
against the address-space's own userbase. The owner of the address
space can then grant access to the console to the users they have
defined. The console server will have a service account that it uses
for interaction with the address controller api when creating and
deleting addresses.

It will maintain authorisation information as to which users in the
address space's userbase are allowed to (a) view the address space and
(b) add/delete addresses within the address space.

=== router & gateways

These are responsible for authenticating AMQP and MQTT connections. At
present all enforcement is actually done at the router level. The MQTT
gateway merely passes on the credentials it receives for each
connection.

=== internal components

Internal components authenticated using client certificates signed by
an internal CA. Verify: this is a per address-space CA?

== sasl delegating mechanism

TODO: Rob

== console authorisation

Permissions for enmasse will be assigned to groups (or roles). The
groups are defined in the authorisation service.

There will be two permissions defined for access to the console:

1. read access

2. write access (allowing creation and deletion of addresses)

The console should use OAuth against Keycloak to verify whether a
given user has been granted these permissions.

== configuring authentication for an address-space

Three options presented to user:

1. No authentication
2. Use enmasse authentication service
3. Use external authentication service

Deploy two authentication services along with address controller:

1. simple null service that always allows access
  * used for no authentication option above
2. keycloak instance with sasl-delegation plugins
  * used for enmasse authentication option above

[NOTE]
Need to update the address model to include the necessary
configuration details for the authentication service to use in the
address space resource schema. This includes host, port and a CA cert
for verifying the authentication services certificate.

Routers will need to specify the the realm for their address-space in
the AMQP open frames hostname field in connections made to the
authentication service via sasl-delegation.

If the host is used to identify the realm, we would need a unique
hostname per address-space, i.e. a route per address-space. That may
be desirable anyway in order to allow a realm specific url for the
keycloak instance.

Alternatively, the realm be taken from the address space name which is
supplied as an environmanet variable.

The address controller will allow the authentication service to be
specified, and will set environment variables in the router deployment
describing the host and port and path to the CA cert to use. The CA
cert will be mounted as a secret.

The address controller will provide the console with credentials to
use when it connects back to the address-controller in order to
create/delete addresses.

When the default option is chosen for the authenticationService, the
address controller will setup a keycloak realm for the address space
with an initial admin user that can view and edit that realm.

== testing

Automated system tests to cover authentication functionality.  test will cover EnMasse Authentication Service and No
Authentication.  External Authentication Service need not be covered through automated system tests as it is identical
from the point of view of an individual address space, and (by definition) an external authentication service is not
part of EnMasse.

[NOTE]
System tests will need to be able to support creation / deletion of address spaces on a per test (method) basis


=== Testing Messaging Client Authentication

==== EnMasse Authentication Service

* Validate successful authentication with enmasse authentication service and valid credentials
 . create an address space `A` which uses the enmasse authentication service
 . add a user `U` with password `P` to the Keycloak domain for `A` (using Keycloak API)
 . verify that AMQP & MQTT messaging clients can establish a connection to `A` using username `U` and password `P`
 . create an address space `B` which uses the enmasse authentication service
 . add a user `U` with password `X` to the Keycloak domain for `B`
 . verify that AMQP & MQTT messaging clients can still establish a connection to `A` using username `U` and password `P`

* Validate unsuccessful authentication with enmasse authentication service with no credentials
 . create an address space `A` which uses the enmasse authentication service
 . verify that AMQP & MQTT messaging clients cannot establish a connection without credentials
 . add a user `U` with password `P` to the Keycloak domain for `A`
 . verify that AMQP & MQTT messaging clients still cannot establish a connection without credentials

* Validate unsuccessful authentication with enmasse authentication service with incorrect credentials
 . create an address space `A` which uses the enmasse authentication service
 . verify that AMQP & MQTT messaging clients cannot establish a connection to `A` using username `U` and password `P`
 . add a user `U` with password `P` to the Keycloak domain for `A`
 . verify that AMQP & MQTT messaging clients cannot establish a connection to `A` using username `U` and password `X`
 . verify that AMQP & MQTT messaging clients cannot establish a connection to `A` using username `V` and password `P`
 . create an address space `B` which uses the enmasse authentication service
 . add a user `U` with password `X` to the Keycloak domain for `B`
 . verify that AMQP & MQTT messaging clients cannot establish a connection to `A` using username `U` and password `X`
 . verify that AMQP & MQTT messaging clients cannot establish a connection to `B` using username `U` and password `P`

==== No Authentication

* Validate successful authentication with no authentication
 . create an address space `A` which uses the enmasse authentication service
 . verify that AMQP & MQTT messaging clients can establish a connection to address space `A` without credentials
 . verify that AMQP & MQTT messaging clients can establish a connection to address space `A` using username `U` and password `P`
 . create an address space `B` which uses the enmasse authentication service
 . verify that AMQP & MQTT messaging clients can still establish a connection to address space `A` without credentials
 . verify that AMQP & MQTT messaging clients can still establish a connection to address space `A` using username `U` and password `P`

=== Testing Console Access

[NOTE]
Do we need to add some basic authz first, or do we just initially allow all users in the domain to have full access to the console?

=== Testing Address Controller / Service Broker

[NOTE]
Here we'll need to potentially have multiple sets of openshift credentials passed in to the tests / these users to be set up prior to the system test execution
