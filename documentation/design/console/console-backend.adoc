== Console Backend.

=== Introduction

The Console Backend is responsible for:

* serving the static content of console ui
* let the end user authenticate to the console
* providing a graphql api that allows the console ui to:
** list, create, update, delete address and address space objects.
** list connections and links
** get metrics for address spaces, address, connections and links.


== High Level

The EnMasse Console is controlled by the consoleservice CR.

There is a console deployment.  The deployment comprises a *console-server* component and *oauth-proxy*.

The *console-server* component will present GraphQL API allowing the view/maintenance of address spaces, addresses,
and connections by the UI.  The model presented object model presented by the EnMasse GraphQL schema is a composite
one that provides access to the resource and metrics through a single query interface.  Mutations permit the
create/patch/delete of address spaces and addresses, the closure of connections and purge of addresses.

The console-server internally maintains a *cache* of address-spaces, addresses and connections, links and metrics.

* address-spaces and addresses are read from the Kubernetes API (utilising watches of the resources).
* connection and link information are gathered from the agents of address spaces themselves.
* metrics will also be scraped *directly* from the agents. 

For read operations, console-graphql uses a service account with *list* permission for address spaces and addresses
in order to build a global view.  It is a responsibility of this component to filter the user's view so that he can see
only those objects to which he has permission.  It will use a `SelfSubjectAccessReview` in order to do this.  The
SelfSubjectAccessReview responses will be cached for a short time, to avoid load on the server.

For write operations, console-server propagates the user's bearer token made available by oauth-proxy.

oauth-proxy provides authentication.

== Components

=== EnMasse Operator

The EnMasse Operator is responsibility for the deployment of the console and the creation of the resources it needs.
Its behaviour differs depending on whether Openshift or a Kubernetes platform is in use.


==== CRD Definition

The CRD encapsulates the following:

- discoveryMetadataURL - a URL referencing an OAuth discovery metadata https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-oauth-discovery-08.html.  Discovery metadata is becoming increasing common, but it allows the url to be a data-url so a user could construct their own discover document if need be.
- certificateSecret a reference to TLS certificate secret
- oauthClientSecret - a secret containing the OAuth client-id and client secret
- ssoCookieSecret - a secret used to crypt the cookie laid by OAuth-Proxy on the browser.  This cookie contains the OAuth/OIDC token.
- ssoCookieDomain - if set, the domain of the cookie laid by OAuth-Proxy
- scope - OAuth scope
- host - hostname used by the Global Console.

==== Resources controlled by the Operator

The Operator uses the information in the Console Service CR to create and keep synchronised the following resources.

- service (with serving-cert-secret-name on OpenShift).
- deployment (with containers for oauth-proxy and console-server)
- secrets
- oauthClientSecret
- ssoCookieDomain
- certificateSecret
- oauthclient (OpenShift only - kept in synch with the oauthClientSecret client-id/secret)
- route (OpenShift only)
- console-link (OpenShift only)

=== oauth-proxy

The console uses OpenShift oauth-proxy for deployments on OpenShift or oauth2-proxy for deployments on Kubernetes.

oauth-proxy is also responsible for serving the static content of the console-ui.

=== console-server

It has the following responsibilities:

* present a GraphQL interface
** for queries - exposing address-spaces, addresses, connection together will link and metric information.
** for mutations - allow creation/patch/delete of address-space/address, connection close, address purge.
* populate cached model with
** address-space and address (from Kubernetes API)
** connections and links (from the addressspaces' agents)
** metrics (from the addressspaces' agents)

==== GraphQL queries

GraphQL Queries will allow the caller to access the cached model.

The GraphQL interface will provide paginated result sets where necessary.  It will follow the _offset
pagination_ pattern https://graphql.org/learn/pagination/ rather than the cursor one.  The cursor one doesn't meet
the requirements of the UI (random access to any page).

Paginated queries accept optional `first` and `offset` arguments.  `first` allows the user to request the first `n` items,
and defaults to infinity.  `offset` allows the user to specify a starting index and defaults to zero.  The paginated
results return a `*QueryResult` object.  This gives access to a `Total` (number of results available) and a list of result objects themselves.

Paginated queries also accept optional `filter` and sort `orderBy`:

* `filter` is expressed as a boolean expression with its operands supporting a JSON Path.  The specification is based
on a SQL-92 WHERE clause syntax. For example:

`.spec.plan == "standard-small-queue"`

* `orderby` is expressed is a comma separated list. Each clause is a JSON path expression followed by an optional
keyword ASC or DESC.

`$.spec.type` ,`$.metadata.name` desc

The queries observe the cache.  They filter the results from the cache to exclude items that the user has no permission to see.  To do this, `SelfSubjectAccessReview` is used, passing the bearer token of the logged on user.  The access review will be cached for a configurable period.

==== GraphQL mutations

There are mutations permitting the create/delete/patch of addressspaces and addresses.  There are mutations
allowing an address to be purged and a connection closed.

Mutations will interact directly the API backends (Kubernetes for addressspaces and addresses and the Agent API for purge
and connection closed).  It will perform this interaction using the user's bearer token.

==== Cache

The console-graphql maintains a cache of namespace/addressspapce/address/connection, link and metric information.

* It uses Kubernetes watches to build cache of namespaces/addressspapce/address.
* It uses the Agent AMQP interface to subscribe for connection/link and address/link information.

In all of these API interactions, the bearer of the service account will be passed to the peer.

==== Metrics

The *gauge* metrics (e.g. queue depth) need no further processing.

Where the console UI requires a *rate* metric it is be console-graphql responsibility to calculate this rate from counter
metrics exposed by the agents.   It does this using the Prometheus query engine itself.

Some guage metrics required are synthesized from the cache.  Examples of this are `enmasse_addresses` (the number of addresses currently defined in an addressspace)

=== Agent

Agent exposes an AMQP interface that allows a subscriber to register for connection/address/link metrics.

Authentication to the AMQP interface is done using XOAUTH2.  The console-server will pass either the bearer token of
the console-server account or the bearer token of the end user.
