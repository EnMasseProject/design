= Using make with documentation

When you make changes to the documentation, it is a good practice to do a local test build to verify the book builds successfully and renders as you expect before you submit the merge request back to upstream master.

Make is a useful tool for building your documentation and pushing it to a public website so that peer and quality reviewers can see your edits as the user would.

== Make commands to build documentation

`make clean`:: Delete all temporary files
`make check`:: Execute the custom checks in `scripts/check_docs.sh`
`make`:: Build the docs using asciidoc, including the generated documentation
`make publish`:: Build the docs via `make build` and publish them using `rsync`. The publish destination is configured via the PUBLISH_DEST parameter.
