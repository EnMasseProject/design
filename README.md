EnMasse provides a self-service messaging platform on Kubernetes and OpenShift with a uniform interface to manage different messaging infrastructure.  See our [website] for more details about the project.

### Supported features

* **Built-in authentication and authorization** - Use the built-in or plug in your own authentication service for authentication and authorization of messaging clients.

* **Self-service messaging for applications** - The service admin deploys and manages the messaging infrastructure, while applications can request messaging resources without caring about the messaging infrastructure.

* **Supports a wide variety of messaging patterns** - Choose between JMS-style messaging with strict guarantees, or messaging that supports a larger number of connections and higher throughput.
